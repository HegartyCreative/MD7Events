        <p>MD7Events was delighted to host an exclusive hospitality event to watch England take on Scotland, "The Auld Enemy", in the oldest international fixture in the world. We enjoyed a fun-filled evening as three headed goals meant England took full control of the World Cup qualifying group.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Foley" target="_blank">Theo Foley.</a> was on hand to give his unique insight into the game and he gave full credit to Scotland for a spirited display. England now top Group F while Scotland languish in fifth, with their hopes of qualifying for the 2018 tournament in Russia fading fast.</p>

        The event supported the <a href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk" target="_blank">British Royal Legion</a> and we're delighted that our guests contributed £80 to such a worthy cause.</a>

    <p>MD7Events are fast becoming a lucky charm for the Irish as we hosted another success for the Martin O'Neill's boys. It wasn't the prettiest of triumps but the winning goal ensured another successful evening was enjoyed by all who attended. </p>
    <p>The new venue at Ye Old Cock Tavern in Holborn was a great success and MD7Events will be sure to return. We look forward to supporting the Irish in their quest to qualify from an extremely competitive qualifying group.</p>

Theo regaled the audience of tales from his long and distinguished career.

It was a revealing and humorous account of professional football at the highest level.</p>
